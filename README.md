## API Calls

### Initialization

#### *Swift*

First import *VoiceIt3IosSDK* in your Swift file then initialize a reference to the SDK inside a ViewController, passing in a reference to the ViewController as the first argument, then the API Credentials, and finally a styles dictionary ( *kThemeColor* can be any hexadecimal color code and *kIconStyle* can be "default" or "monochrome").

```swift
import VoiceIt3IosSDK

class ViewController: UIViewController {
    var myVoiceIt:VoiceItAPIThree?

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        /* Reference to ViewController , API Credentials and styles dictionary*/
        let styles = NSMutableDictionary(dictionary: ["kThemeColor":"#FBC132","kIconStyle":"default"])
        self.myVoiceIt = VoiceItAPIThree(self, apiKey: "API_KEY_HERE", apiToken: "API_TOKEN_HERE", styles: styles)
    }
}
```
#### *Objective-C*

First import *VoiceItAPIThree.h* into your Objective-C file, then initialize a reference to the SDK inside a ViewController, passing in a reference to the ViewController as the first argument.

```objc
#import "ViewController.h"
#import "VoiceItAPIThree.h"

@interface ViewController ()
    @property VoiceItAPIThree * myVoiceIt;
@end

@implementation ViewController

- (void)viewDidLoad {
    [super viewDidLoad];
    /* Reference to ViewController , API Credentials and styles dictionary*/
    NSMutableDictionary * styles = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init];
    [styles setObject:@"#FBC132" forKey:@"kThemeColor"];
    [styles setObject:@"default" forKey:@"kIconStyle"];
    self.myVoiceIt = [[VoiceItAPIThree alloc] init:self apiKey:@"API_KEY_HERE" apiToken:@"API_TOKEN_HERE" styles: styles];
}
```
### Encapsulated Methods

#### Encapsulated Voice Enrollment

Creates three voice enrollments for user with the given userId(begins with 'usr_') and contentLanguage('en-US','es-ES' etc.) and a given phrase such as "my face and voice identify me". Note: Immediately upon calling this method it displays the enrollment view controller that completely takes care of the three enrollments, including the UI, and provides relevant callbacks for whether the user cancelled their enrollments or successfully completed them.

##### *Swift*
```swift
myVoiceIt?.encapsulatedVoiceEnrollUser("USER_ID_HERE", contentLanguage: "CONTENT_LANGUAGE_HERE", voicePrintPhrase: "my face and voice identify me", userEnrollmentsCancelled: {
    print("User Enrollment Cancelled")
}, userEnrollmentsPassed: {
    print("User Enrollments Passed")
})
```

##### *Objective-C*
```objc
[self.myVoiceIt encapsulatedVoiceEnrollUser:@"USER_ID_HERE" contentLanguage:@"CONTENT_LANGUAGE_HERE" voicePrintPhrase:@"my face and voice identify me" userEnrollmentsCancelled:^{
    NSLog(@"User Enrollments Cancelled");
} userEnrollmentsPassed:^{
    NSLog(@"User Enrollments Passed");
}];
```

#### Encapsulated Face Enrollment

Creates a face enrollment for user with the given userId(begins with 'usr_'). Note: Immediately upon calling this method it displays the enrollment view controller that completely takes care of enrolling the user's face, including the UI, and provides relevant callbacks for whether the user cancelled their enrollment or successfully completed it.

##### *Swift*
```swift
myVoiceIt?.encapsulatedFaceEnrollUser("USER_ID_HERE", userEnrollmentsCancelled: {
    print("User Enrollment Cancelled")
}, userEnrollmentsPassed: {
    print("User Enrollments Passed")
})
```

##### *Objective-C*

##### *Swift*
```swift
myVoiceIt?.encapsulatedVideoEnrollUser("USER_ID_HERE", contentLanguage: "CONTENT_LANGUAGE_HERE", voicePrintPhrase: "my face and voice identify me", userEnrollmentsCancelled: {

myVoiceIt?.encapsulatedVoiceVerification("USER_ID_HERE", contentLanguage: "CONTENT_LANGUAGE_HERE", voicePrintPhrase: "my face and voice identify me", userVerificationCancelled: {
    print("User Cancelled Verification");
